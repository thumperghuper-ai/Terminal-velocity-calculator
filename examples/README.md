# Examples

This directory contains a number of examples which constitute a basic tutorial
covering a range of common use cases.

## US 16in

In this case we have a portion of a detailed range table available and limited
information about the projectile. The example constitutes recreating the
portion of the range table that we have, and in the process determining some
properties about the projectile. The example is documented
[here](/examples/16in_modeling_run.md).

## UK 16in Mark1B

In this case we have a very coarse range table with 5000 yard increments, and
reasonably detailed information about the projectile. This should provide enough
information to create a detailed range table, but will expose more of the
limitations of the code when dealing with less detailed source data. The example
can be found [here](/examples/16in_mark1b.md)
