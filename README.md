# Master Exterior Ballistics Program

A simple exterior ballistics modeling tool based on code written by W. J.
Jurens, published in Warship International, No. 1, 1984, "Exterior Ballistics
with Microcomputers".

The code is designed to emulate the calculations that were done to generate
range tables prior to the convergence of exterior ballistics and aerodynamics.
This may make the method used a little opaque to more aerodynamically minded
users, but the underlying concepts are closely related and can be easily
translated (though the details are beyond the scope of this document).
